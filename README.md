E-commerce Data Analysis
This project analyzes e-commerce data to extract insights and visualize them. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key metrics to understand sales performance and customer behavior.

Setup
1. Install dependencies
First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Clean the data
Run the data cleaning script to preprocess the dataset. This script will load the raw data, clean it, and save the cleaned data in the data/ directory.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/data_cleaning.py
3. Perform data analysis and visualization
Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the notebooks/ directory to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize the data.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
4. Generate a PDF report
Run the data visualization script to generate visualizations and compile a PDF report of the analysis. The report will be saved in the reports/ directory.

bash
Copy code
python scripts/data_visualization.py
Data
Place your e-commerce data in the data/ directory. The data should be in CSV format with columns such as:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order
Product: Name of the product
Quantity Ordered: Number of units ordered
Price Each: Price per unit
Order Date: Date when the order was placed
Purchase Address: Address where the order was delivered
Data Cleaning
The data cleaning script (scripts/data_cleaning.py) performs the following steps:

Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
Converts the 'Order Date' column to datetime format.
Removes duplicate rows.
Handles missing values by removing rows with any null values.
Adds a 'TotalPrice' column calculated as Quantity Ordered * Price Each.
Saves the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Jupyter Notebook (notebooks/analysis.ipynb) includes:

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics of the dataset.
Sales Distribution by State: A count plot showing the number of sales in each state.
Monthly Sales Trend: A time series plot showing sales over time.
Top Selling Products: A bar plot showing the top 10 products by quantity sold.
Data Visualization
The data visualization script (scripts/data_visualization.py) creates and saves the following visualizations:

Sales Distribution by State: sales_by_state.png
Monthly Sales Trend: monthly_sales.png
Top Selling Products: top_products.png
It also generates a comprehensive PDF report (reports/ecommerce_report.pdf) containing all the visualizations with descriptive titles and explanations.

Report
The final report, ecommerce_report.pdf, provides an overview of the sales data analysis, including key insights and visualizations. This report is useful for understanding sales performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven business decisions.

Requirements
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
fpdf
Usage
Follow the setup instructions to install dependencies, clean the data, perform analysis, and generate the report. Modify the scripts and notebook as needed to tailor the analysis to your specific requirements.
